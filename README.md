# xflp
xflp is a solver for truck loading problems in 3D with real world constraints

It support:
* single or multiple bin packing
* rotating of items for 1 axis
* Constraints:
  * Max height of loading space
  * Max weight of loading space
  * Max bearing weight of each item
* multiple stacking groups

Optimization:
* Contruction heuristic
* GRASP heuristic
